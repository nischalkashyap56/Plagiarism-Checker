# Plagiarism-Checker
A plagiarism checker that uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorisation to transform text into numerical vectors, and then uses cosine similarities to check similarity scores between different C files in the current local directory. After running the algorithm, using Flask, the results are displayed onto a web application.

The following project is implemented using Python as the programming language. Some of the functionalities implemented are :
1. Registration of a new user
2. Adding files to check into the local directory
3. Login for a particular user
4. Cross checking files using the Machine Learning algorithm to get a similarity score
5. Displaying a user-friendly view of the results on the web application

## Note 

- There are 6 additional factorial.c files and fibonacci.c files for the sake of explanation and demonstration of the program which would effectively identify plagiarism in C code.
